\bigskip

A Hilbert space is a vector space $H$ with an inner product
$\langle f,g\rangle$ such that the norm defined by
$$|f|=\sqrt{\langle f,g\rangle}$$
turns $H$ into a complete metric space. If the inner product does not so
define a norm, it is instead known as an inner product space.

\bigskip

Examples of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces include

1. The real numbers $R^n$ with $\langle v,u\rangle$ the vector dot product of
$v$ and $u$.

2. The complex numbers $C^n$ with $\langle v,u\rangle$ the vector dot product
of $v$ and the complex conjugate of $u$.
