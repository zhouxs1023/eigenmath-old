2. Bowl $A$ contains two red chips;
bowl $B$ contains two white chips;
bowl $C$ contains one red chip and one white chip;
bowl $D$ contains one red chip and one blue chip;
bowl $E$ contains one white chip and one blue chip.
A bowl is randomly selected, and one chip is taken at random.
If the selected chip is white, what is the probability that
the other chip in the bowl is red?

\bigskip
We have
$$\eqalign{
A&=(red,red)\cr
B&=(white,white)\cr
C&=(red,white)\cr
D&=(red,blue)\cr
E&=(white,blue)\cr
}$$
Bowl $C$ is the only bowl with a red and white chip our task
is to find
$$P\{C|white\}$$
Since each chip has an equal probability of being selected we have
$$P\{white\}={4\over10}$$
$$P\{C|white\}={P\{white\cap C\}\over P\{white\}}
={P\{C\}P\{white|C\}\over P\{white\}}
={(1/5)\times(1/2)\over4/10}={1\over4}$$
