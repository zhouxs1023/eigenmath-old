18.3. Use calculus to find the maximum and minimum of
$f(x)=x^3-6x^2+9x+1$ on $[0,5)$.

\bigskip

The maximum and minimum occur where $df/dx=0$.
$$df/dx=3x^2-12x+9=0$$
This equation has two solutions, $x=1$ and $x=3$.
That was easy. Now we have to work harder.

1. Use the ``first derivative test'' to see if $x=1$ is a minimum or maximum.
Since $f'(0)>0$ and $f'(2)<0$ we conclude that $x=1$ is a local maximum.

2. Repeat for $x=3$.
Since $f'(2)<0$ and $f'(4)>0$ we conclude that $x=3$ is a local minimum.

3. Now compute $f$ at $x=0,1,3,5$ and compare.

$f(0)=1$

$f(1)=5$

$f(3)=1$

$f(5)=21$.

We observe that $f(5)=21$ is the maximum 
but since the interval is open on the 5 side, we conclude that $f$
has no maximum.
The function $f$ has two minima, one at $f(0)$ and the other at $f(1)$.

4. I just realized that I could have skipped steps 1 and 2.
The computation of $f$ at $x=0,1,3,5$ is all that's needed.
Also, the ``second derivative test'' is an easier way to find out if $x_0$ is a
local minimum or maximum:

$f''(x_0)>0$ means $x_0$ is a local minimum,

$f''(x_0)<0$ means $x_0$ is a local maximum.

BTW, {\tt gnuplot} was a big help in solving the problem.
