1.6 A transmission link with a -2 dB TLP at the transmit end and a -4 dB TLP
at the receive end is part of a voice circuit that produces the following
idle channel noise measurements: 18 dBrnCO at the transmit end and 20 dBrnCO
at the receive end. What is the contribution (in pWpO) of the transmission
link toward the total absolute power at the receive end?
