\beginsection Trick

To find $\mu$ from $P(X<x)$
$$\hbox{\tt NORMINV(p,0,1)}={x-\mu\over\sigma}$$

\beginsection Example

The average life of a machine is normally distributed
with standard deviation 2.25 years.
After 4.01 years, 33\% of the machines fail.
What is the average life?
$$\hbox{\tt NORMINV(0.33,0,1)}=-0.43991$$
$$\mu=4.01-(2.25)(-0.43991)=5$$
