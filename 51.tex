3.2 Derive an expression for the average quantization noise power that
occurs when the decoder output samples are offset from the center of the
quantization interval by a distance equal to 25\% of the interval.
(The output values are at the 75\% point instead of the 50\% point.)
How much degradation in decibels does this offset represent?
(Assuming uncorrelated offsets.)

\bigskip

From Appendix A, this is the quantization noise power.
$$\int_{-q/2}^{q/2}\left({1\over q}\right)x^2\,dx={q^2\over12}$$
Change the range of the integral to get
$$\eqalign{
\int_{-q/4}^{3q/4}\left({1\over q}\right)x^2\,dx
&={x^3\over3q}\bigg|_{-q/4}^{3q/4}\cr
&={1\over3q}\left({27\over64}q^3+{1\over64}q^3\right)\cr
&={7\over48}q^2\cr
}$$
The ratio of noise power yields the degradation in decibels.
$$10\log_{10}\left({7q^2/48\over q^2/12}\right)=2.43\,{\rm dB}$$
