Prove that the empty set is a subset of every set.

\bigskip
Let there be a set $A$ such that $\emptyset\not\subset A$.
Then there is a member of $\emptyset$ that is not a member of $A$.
Since the empty set has no members, this is a contradiction.
Hence there is no $A$ such that $\emptyset\not\subset A$.
Therefore the empty set is a subset of every set.
