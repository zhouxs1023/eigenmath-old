1.4 An idle channel noise power measurement of 21 dBrnC occurs at
a $-7$ dB TLP. Express the noise power of this measurement in dBrnCO and
determine what power measurement this noise would produce at another
point in the circuit that is designated as a $-2$ dB TLP.

\bigskip

The measurement is at $-7$ dB TLP.
At 0 dB TLP, the value is 7 dB higher or 28 dBrnCO.
At $-2$ dB TLP, the value is 2 dB lower than 0 dB TLP, or 26 dBrnC.
