(1) Verify that the inverse of a bijective homomorphism
(between monoids or groups) is again a homomorphism and show
that the relation of isomorphism is an equivalence relation
(i.e. reflexive, symmetric and transitive).

$$groupoid \rightarrow semigroup \rightarrow monoid \rightarrow group$$

The hierarchy goes like this.
A groupoid is a set plus a binary map.
A semigroup is a groupoid with an associative binary map.
A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.
A group is a monoid with an inverse element.
