\beginsection
Product cancellation law

For all $a,b,c\in Z$, if $a\ne 0$ and $a\cdot b=a\cdot c$, then $b=c$.

\beginsection
Trichotomy law

For all $a\in Z$ exactly one of the following is true:
$a\in N$, $a=0$ or $-a\in N$.

\beginsection
Well-ordering principle

If $S$ is a nonempty subset of $N$, then there is an $a\in S$ such that
$a\le b$ for every $b\in S$.

\beginsection
Principle of induction

Let $S\subset N$ with $1\in S$ and for every $n\in S$ we also have $n+1\in S$.
Then $S=N$.

\beginsection
Division algorithm theorem

If $a,b\in Z$ such that $a\ne 0$, then there is a unique $q$ and $r$
such that $b=a\cdot q+r$ and $0\le r<|a|$.

\beginsection
Euclidean algorithm theorem

Let $a,b\in Z$ such that $a\ne 0$ and $b\ne 0$.
Then $gcd(a,b)$ exists and there are $x,y\in Z$ such that
$gcd(a,b)=ax+by$.
