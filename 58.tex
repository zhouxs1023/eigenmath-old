{\bf Problem A.} Let $S=\{(x,y)\in{\rm Z}^2:x^2+y^2=1\}$.
%(1) List all the elements of $S$.
%(2) Find the domain and image of $S$.

\bigskip
(1) The set $S$ has four elements, $S=\{(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)\}$.

\bigskip
(2) The domain of relation $S$ is $\{-1,0,1\}$.
The image of relation $S$ is the same.

\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf Problem B.} Are the following relations also functions from
$A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ to $B=\{-3,-2,-1\}$?

\bigskip
{\bf 1.} $f=\{(1,-3),(2,-2),(3,-2),(4,1)\}$
\smallskip
No, $f$ is not a function because it is not a relation from $A$ into $B$.
The problem is $(4,1)\not\in A\times B$ therefore $f$ is not a subset of
$A\times B$.
In addition we have $4,5\not\in Dom(f)$ so $f$ fails the domain condition as
well.

\bigskip
{\bf 2.} $g=\{(1,-1),(2,-1),(3,-1),(4,-1),(5,-1)$
\smallskip
Yes, it is a function.

\bigskip
{\bf 3.} $h=\{(1,-1),(2,-1),(3,-1),(4,-3),(2,-3),(5,-1)\}$
\smallskip
No, it is not a function because it is not well-defined.
The two members $(2,-1)$ and $(2,-3)$ are the problem.

\bigskip
{\bf 4.} $k=\{(1,-1),(2,-1),(3,2),(4,-3),(5,1)\}$
\smallskip
No, $k$ is not a function because it is not a relation from $A$ into $B$.
The problem is $(3,2),(5,1)\not\in A\times B$
therefore $k$ is not a subset of $A\times B$.
In addition we have $3,5\not\in Dom(k)$ so $k$ fails the domain requirement as
well.

\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf Problem C.} Find a binary operation for $A=\{1,2,3\}$.
\smallskip
A simple approach is to map every member of the domain to 1.
$$\oplus=\{
((1,1),1),((1,2),1),((1,3),1),
((2,1),1),((2,2),1),((2,3),1),
((3,1),1),((3,2),1),((3,3),1)\}
$$
How many possible binary operations are there?
For each member of $Dom(\oplus)$ we have three ways to choose the second
component.
In other words, for each $((a,b),c)$ we have three ways to choose $c$.
Therefore there are $3^9=19,683$ possible binary operations for $A$.
