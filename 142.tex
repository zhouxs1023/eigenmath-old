\beginsection Hypergeometric distribution

Random variable $X$ is the number of successes in a sample.
$$\hbox{\tt HYPGEOMDIST(sample\_s,number\_sample,population\_s,number\_pop)}$$
$$\mu=n\times{D\over N},\qquad\hbox{n=sample\_s, D=population\_s, N=number\_pop}$$

\beginsection Example

An urn contains 4 red balls and 16 white balls.
What is the probability that there are exactly 2 red balls when 5 balls
are drawn without replacement?
$$\hbox{\tt HYPGEOMDIST(2,5,4,20)}=0.2167$$
