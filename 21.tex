\noindent
1. A square acre measures approximately $208.71$ feet on each side.
What is the dimension exactly?

\medskip
640 acres is a square mile. One side of a square mile is 5280 feet.
Now we consider how many acre plots can we line up on one side of
a square mile.
Since there are 640 acres total, there must be $\sqrt{640}$ on each side.
Therefore one side of an acre must be $5280/\sqrt{640}$ feet
which is equivalent to $5280/(8\sqrt{10})$ feet
which is equivalent to $660/\sqrt{10}$ feet.
