\beginsection Negative Binomial (Pascal) Distribution

\bigskip
\item{4.} A military commander wishes to destroy an enemy bridge.
Each flight of planes he sends out has a probability of 0.8 of
scoring a direct hit on the bridge.
It takes four direct hits to completely destroy the bridge.
If he can mount seven assaults before the bridge is
tactically unimportant, what is the probability that the
bridge will be destroyed?

\bigskip
Solution: We need 4 successes so this looks like a
Pascal distribution.
For example, $p(5)$ is the probability of
success on the 5th flight.
With $p=0.8$ and $k=4$ we have
$$p(x)={}_{x-1}C_{k-1}p^k(1-p)^{x-k}=
{}_{x-1}C_{3}(0.8)^4(0.2)^{x-4}$$
The probability of destroying the bridge in 7 flights
or less is
$$P(X\le7)=\sum_{x=4}^7p(x)=0.9667$$
