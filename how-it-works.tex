\chapter{How it works}

Eigenmath is written in the C programming language.
Its central data structure is
an array of one million 16-byte blocks of memory.
\begin{verbatim}
         _______ 
      0 |_______|  \
      1 |_______|   |
      2 |_______|   |
        |       |   |
        .       .   | 16,000,000 bytes
        .       .   |
        .       .   |
        |_______|   |
999,999 |_______|  /
\end{verbatim}
If necessary, Eigenmath will allocate additional memory in increments of one
million blocks.
The maximum amount of memory allocated is 160 million bytes,
or ten times what is shown above.

\noindent
Each block can contain different types of information.
Blocks are linked together to store mathematical expressions.
For example, the following shows how the expression
{\it A times B plus C} is stored.
\begin{verbatim}
 _______      _______                                _______
|CONS   |--->|CONS   |----------------------------->|CONS   |
|       |    |       |                              |       |
|_______|    |_______|                              |_______|
    |            |                                      |
 ___v___      ___v___      _______      _______      ___v___
|ADD    |    |CONS   |--->|CONS   |--->|CONS   |    |SYMBOL |
|       |    |       |    |       |    |       |    |C      |
|_______|    |_______|    |_______|    |_______|    |_______|
                 |            |            |
              ___v___      ___v___      ___v___
             |TIMES  |    |SYMBOL |    |SYMBOL |
             |       |    |A      |    |B      |
             |_______|    |_______|    |_______|
\end{verbatim}
Only CONS blocks contain pointers to other blocks.
Every other kind of block is a terminal node.
Fundamentally, this is the same as the S-expression data structure invented by
John McCarthy for the
LISP programming language.
