{\bf Hypergeometric Distribution}

\bigskip
In a batch of 30 resistors, 10 are defective.

\bigskip
1. If ten resistors are randomly selected from the batch,
what is the probability that exactly three are defective?
$$\hbox{\tt HYPGEOMDIST(3,10,10,30)}=0.3096$$

\bigskip
2. If eight resistors are randomly selected from the batch,
what is the probability that at most two are defective?
$$\hbox{\tt HYPGEOMDIST(0,8,10,30)+HYPGEOMDIST(1,8,10,30)+HYPGEOMDIST(2,8,10,30)}
=0.4520$$

\bigskip
3. If five resistors are randomly selected from the batch,
what is the probability that at least two are defective?
$$\hbox{\tt 1-HYPGEOMDIST(0,5,10,30)-HYPGEOMDIST(1,5,10,30)}=0.5512$$
