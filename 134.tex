5. The useful life of a personal computer at the UIS computer center
is known to be normally distributed with mean 3.25 years and
standard deviation 0.5 years.
$$\mu=3.25$$
$$\sigma=0.5$$

\bigskip
{\bf (a) What is the probability that a personal computer selected
randomly has a useful life of at leat 3.75 years?}
$$P(X>3.75)=1-P(X<3.75)=1-\hbox{\tt NORMDIST(3.75,3.25,0.5,TRUE)}=0.1587$$

\bigskip
{\bf (b) What is the probability that a personal computer selected
randomly has a useful life of at least 2 years but less than 4 years?}
$$P(2<X<4)=\hbox{\tt NORMDIST(4,3.25,0.5,TRUE)}-\hbox{\tt NORMDIST(2,3.25,0.5,TRUE)}
=0.9270$$

\bigskip
{\bf (c) Historically 17.36\% of the personal computers have had a useful
life less than the manufacturer's advertised life.
What is the manufacturer's advertised life?}
$$P(X<a)=0.1736$$
$$a=\hbox{\tt NORMINV(0.1736,3.25,0.5)}=2.78\,\hbox{years}$$
