\beginsection Try out 2.1

Verify that $d_T$ as defined in the proposition, satisfies the
three conditions of Definition 2.11
$$d_T(P,Q)=|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|$$

\medskip
(i) Verify that $d(P,Q)\ge0$. Solution: The use of absolute value
ensures that $d_T\ge0$.
\medskip
(ii) Verify that $d(P,Q)=0$ if and only if $P=Q$. Solution:
If $P=Q$ then $x_1=x_2$, $y_1=y_2$, and $d_T=0$.
Conversely, if $d_T(P,Q)=0$ then
$$|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|=0$$
Since both addends are nonnegative, the only way for their
sum to be zero is if the addends themselves are zero.
Hence $x_1=x_2$, $y_1=y_2$, and therefore $P=Q$.
\medskip
(iii) Verify that $d(P,Q)=d(Q,P)$. Solution:
The absolute value permits us to exchange interior operands.
Hence
$$|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|=|x_2-x_1|+|y_2-y_1|=d(Q,P)$$
