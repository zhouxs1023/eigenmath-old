1) Need interval estimation of the mean, variance is known,
large sample size. See lecture042, p. 9.
$$\sigma=1.5$$
$$n=64$$
$$\bar Y=16.4$$
$$1-\alpha=0.95$$
$$Z_{\alpha/2}=1.96$$
The confidence interval is
$$\bar Y\pm Z_{\alpha/2}\sigma/\sqrt n=16.4\pm0.3675
=(16.03,\,16.77)$$

2) Need sample size for estimating proportion, $p$ is unknown.
See lecture044, p. 8.
$$\epsilon=0.01$$
$$1-\alpha=0.99$$
$$Z_{\alpha/2}=2.576$$
$$n=(Z_{\alpha/2}/(2\epsilon/2))^2=16589.44$$
Always round up.
$$n=16{,}589$$

3) Need interval estimation of the mean, variance is unknown,
normal distribution.
See lecture042, p. 19.
$$n=16$$
$$\bar Y=65.94$$
$$S=4.106$$
$$1-\alpha=0.90$$
$$t_{(n-1,\alpha/2)}=t_{(15,0.05)}=1.753$$
$$t_{(n-1,\alpha/2)}S/\sqrt n=1.753\cdot4.106/\sqrt{16}=1.7995$$
The confidence interval is
$$\bar Y\pm t_{(n-1,\alpha/2)}S/\sqrt n
=65.94\pm1.800=(64.14,\,67.74)$$
