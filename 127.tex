\item{6.} An urn contains 10 black balls and 5 white balls.
A ball is drawn at random from the urn and replaced by a
black ball.
What is the expected number of draws needed so that
all of the balls in the urn are black?

\bigskip
Solution: The problem here is that the trials are
not independent.
So let us just think for a moment about replacing the first
white ball.
We see that it is going take a number of trials
until a white ball is drawn, so it is like a
geometric distribution with $p=5/15=1/3$.
We have
$$\mu={1-p\over p}=2$$
So on average 2 draws are required {\it before} drawing the first
white ball.
Then we need to add 1 draw for the white ball itself.
After that, the probability of drawing a white ball
changes to $p=4/15$ and now we see the pattern.
$$\mu=\sum_{n=5,4,3,2,1}\left({1-n/15\over n/15}+1\right)
=\sum{15\over n}=3+3.75+5+7.5+15=34.25$$
