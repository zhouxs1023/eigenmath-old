\item{6.} An urn contains 10 black balls and 5 white balls.
A ball is drawn at random from the urn and replaced by a
black ball.
What is the expected number of draws needed so that
all of the balls in the urn are black?

\bigskip
Solution: Let us think for a moment about replacing the first
white ball.
The negative binomial distribution with $k=1$ and $p=5/15$ can be used.
We have
$$\mu={k\over p}={1\over5/15}={15\over5}$$
So on average 3 draws are required to replace the first white ball.
After that, the probability of drawing a white ball
changes to $p=4/15$ and a pattern becomes evident.
$$\mu=\sum_{n=5,4,3,2,1}{15\over n}
=3+3.75+5+7.5+15=34.25$$
