16. What is the volume of the solid formed by revolving about the $x$-axis
the region in the first quadrant of the $xy$-plane bounded by the coordinate
axes and the graph of the equation $\displaystyle{y={1\over\sqrt{1+x^2}}}$?

\bigskip
This problem involves a number of tricks.
First, visualize the graph.
We have $y(0)=1$ and the graph approaches zero as $x$ increases.
Next, this is a rotation so convert to cylindrical coordinates.
We want $x$ to become a function of $y$ so invert the function.
$$y={1\over\sqrt{1+x^2}}
\quad\rightarrow\quad
{1\over y^2}=1+x^2
\quad\rightarrow\quad
x=\sqrt{{1\over y^2}-1}
$$
Now we can write
$$V=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\left(\sqrt{{1\over r^2}-1}\right)\,r\,dr\,d\theta$$
where the extra $r$ is due to the change of coordinates, i.e.,
$dx\,dy=r\,dr\,d\theta$.
The $r$ cancels nicely and we have
$$V=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\sqrt{1-r^2}\,\,dr\,d\theta$$
There appears to be no shortcut to the next step.
One must simply recall that
$$\int\sqrt{1-r^2}\,dr={\sin^{-1}r+r\sqrt{1-r^2}\over2}$$
Hence
$$\int_0^1\sqrt{1-r^2}\,\,dr={\sin^{-1}r+r\sqrt{1-r^2}\over2}\,\bigg|_0^1={\pi\over4}$$
And finally
$$V=\int_0^{2\pi}{\pi\over4}\,d\theta
={\pi\theta\over4}\bigg|_0^{2\pi}
={\pi^2\over2}$$

\bigskip
The interesting thing about this problem is the area under $y(x)$ is infinite
but the volume when it is rotated is finite.
