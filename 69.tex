4. Confidence interval for a true mean difference.
This exercise is like the example on p. 15 of
lecture045{.}ppt.
$$n=8$$
$$D=753,862,859,968,316,847,893,498$$
$$\bar D=749.5$$
$$S_D=224.8$$
$$1-\alpha=0.99,\quad\alpha/2=0.005$$
$$t_{(7,0.005)}=3.499$$
The confidence interval is
$$\bar D\pm(t_{(7,0.005)}S_D/\sqrt8)=749.5\pm278.1$$
$$(471.4,1027.6)$$
I used Excel to calculate $S_D$.
