25. Show that the non-zero residue classes modulo $p$ form a group with
respect to multiplication if and only if $p$ is prime.

\medskip
As a counter-example, for $p=4$ we have
$S=\{[1],[2],[3]\}$.
The problem is that some products have residue 0.
For example, $2\times2=4$ has residue zero which is not in $S$.
What we need is $p$ with no factors so that we
cannot generate a multiple of $p$ which has residue 0.
So $p$ must be prime.
