4a. Balls are drawn (one at a time) from an urn containing M balls numbered from
1 to $M$. The ball is kept if it is numbered 1, and returned to the urn
otherwise. What is the probability that the second ball drawn is numbered 2?

\bigskip
Recall that $P(A\cap B)$ is the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur.
Here is an important equation from page 37 of the book that we'll need to
calculate $P(A\cap B)$.
$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A)$$

\bigskip
Ok, now we can start on the problem.
Let $A$ be the event that ball number 1 is drawn.
Then
$$P(A)={1\over M},\qquad P(A^\prime)=1-P(A)=1-{1\over M}$$
Let $B$ be the event that ball 2 is drawn.
If $B$ occurs after $A$ then the urn contains $M-1$ balls.
If $B$ occurs after $A^\prime$ then the urn contains $M$ balls.
Hence
$$P(B|A)={1\over M-1},\qquad P(B|A^\prime)={1\over M}$$
From the equation on page 37 we have
$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A)={1\over M^2-M}$$
$$P(A^\prime\cap B)=P(A')P(B|A')={1\over M}-{1\over M^2}$$
Now what we really want to know is $P(B)$ so we have to work
backwards for a little while.
$$\eqalign{
P(B)&=P((A\cup A')\cap B)\cr
&=P((A\cap B)\cup(A'\cap B))\cr
&=P(A\cap B)+P(A'\cap B)-P(A\cap B\cap A'\cap B)\cr
}$$
Note that $P(A\cap B\cap A'\cap B)=0$ so we have
$$P(B)=P(A\cap B)+P(A'\cap B)$$
Now we can substitute and obtain
$$P(B)={1\over M^2-M}+{1\over M}-{1\over M^2}$$

\end
