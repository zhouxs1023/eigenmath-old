In a certain population, 60\% of them are non-smokers,
70\% of them are female and 35\% of them are female
smokers. If a person is selected at random, what is
the probability the person is a female non-smoker?

\bigskip
We have
$$\eqalign{
P(S')&=0.6\cr
P(F)&=0.7\cr
P(F\cap S)&=0.35\cr
}$$
We want to find
$$P(F\cap S')$$
Here is the trick.
$$\eqalign{
P(F\cap S')&=P(F)-P(F\cap S)\cr
&=0.7-0.35\cr
&=0.35
}$$
When I first tried the problem I expanded
$P(F\cap S')=P(F)+P(S')-P(F\cup S')$ which is no help at all.
