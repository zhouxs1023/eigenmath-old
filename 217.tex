18.1. Let $f$ be as in Theorem 18.1. Show that if $-f$ assumes its maximum at
$x_0\in[a,b]$, then $f$ assumes its minimum at $x_0$.

\bigskip
\noindent
By the hypothesis that $x_0$ is a maximum and by Theorem 18.1 it is true that
$$-f(x_0)\ge-f(x)\qquad\hbox{for all $x\in[a,b]$}$$
Multiply through by $-1$ to obtain
$$f(x_0)\le f(x)\qquad\hbox{for all $x\in[a,b]$}$$
Hence $f$ assumes its minimum at $x_0$.
