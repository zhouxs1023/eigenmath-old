There are seven cards, three cards have one side
painted blue and the other four cards have one
side painted red. The cards are placed randomly
with the painted side down and are then turned up
one at a time until a red card is turned up.
At the end of the game, the payoff is the square
of the number of cards that are not turned up.
Find the expected payoff.

\bigskip
The ``expected'' payoff is the average payoff.

\bigskip
There are 3 blue cards, 4 red cards.

\bigskip
What are the chances that the 1st card is red?\par
The chances are $4/7$ and the payoff is 36.

\bigskip
What are the chances that the 2nd card is red?\par
The chances are $3/7\times4/6=2/7$ and the payoff is 25.

\bigskip
What are the chances that the 3rd card is red?\par
The chances are $3/7\times2/6\times4/5=4/35$ and the payoff is 16.

\bigskip
What are the chances that the 4th card is red?\par
The chances are $3/7\times2/6\times1/5\times4/4=1/35$ and the payoff is 9.

\bigskip
Check:
$${4\over7}+{2\over7}+{4\over35}+{1\over35}=1$$

The average payoff is:
$${4\over7}\times36+{2\over7}\times25+{4\over35}\times16+{1\over35}\times9={149\over5}=29.8$$
