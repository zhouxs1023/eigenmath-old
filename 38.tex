Find the determinant of the following $4\times4$ matrix.
$$D=\pmatrix{
1&0&4&-1\cr
-4&0&2&0\cr
3&2&2&1\cr
2&5&3&2\cr
}$$

\bigskip
Solution: Clear out the 4th column.

\bigskip
$R_1+R_3\rightarrow R_1$

$R_4-2R_3\rightarrow R_4$
$$\pmatrix{
4&2&6&0\cr
-4&0&2&0\cr
3&2&2&1\cr
-4&1&-1&0\cr
}$$

\bigskip
Now this is very important and I missed it the first time.
We have to multiply the final result by $(-1)^{3+4}=-1$ due to
the pivot of the cofactor expansion being on row 3, column 4.

\bigskip
Continuing with the cofactor expansion we now need to compute the
determinant of the following minor.
$$\pmatrix{
4&2&6\cr
-4&0&2\cr
-4&1&-1\cr
}$$

\bigskip
The cofactor expansion of the first row is
$$
4\bigg[(0)(-1)-(1)(2)\bigg]
-2\bigg[(-4)(-1)-(-4)(2)\bigg]
+6\bigg[(-4)(1)-(-4)(0)\bigg]
$$
which is
$$4(-2)-2(12)+6(-4)=-56$$

\bigskip
Multiply this by $-1$ due to the $(-1)^{3+4}$ in the original pivot to obtain
$$\det D=56$$

\bigskip
For some reason, when computing determinants I have a tendency to foul up
when products involve zero.
For example, I'll see $(-4)(0)$ and get the result $-4$.
Don't forget, something times zero is zero!
