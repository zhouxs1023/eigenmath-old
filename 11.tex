Example 1. Prove that $\lim(1/n^2)=0$.

1. Let $\epsilon>0$.

2. Let $N=1/\sqrt\epsilon$. (As follows: Start with $1/N^2=\epsilon$. Flip both sides to get
$N^2=1/\epsilon$. Square root of both sides to get $N=1/\sqrt\epsilon$.)

3. Now take the assertion $n>N$ and manipulate as follows:

4. Substitute $1/\sqrt\epsilon$ for $N$: $n>1/\sqrt\epsilon$

5. Square both sides: $n^2>1/\epsilon$

6. Multiply both sides by $\epsilon/n^2$: $\epsilon>1/n^2$

7. Flip end-to-end: $1/n^2<\epsilon$

8. Dress it up a little: $|1/n^2-0|<\epsilon$

9. Thus $n>N$ implies $|1/n^2-0|<\epsilon$

10. This proves that $\lim(1/n^2)=0$.
