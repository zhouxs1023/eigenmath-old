{\bf Moment generating function trick}

\bigskip
%$M(t)$ is the moment generating function,
$\phi(t)=\ln M(t)$ is the generating function.
$$E(X)={d\phi\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}={dM\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}$$
Here is the more important relation
$$Var(X)={d^2\phi\over dt^2}\bigg|_{t=0}=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$$
In a nutshell, it is easier to calculate $Var(X)$ from $\phi(t)$
than from $M(t)$.
