3.1 Assume a signal consists of three tones: one at 1 kHz, one at 10 kHz,
and one at 21 kHz.
What tones will be present at the output of a PAM decoder is the sampling
rate is 12 kHz and the input is unfiltered?
(Assume the output filter cutoff frequency is 6 kHz.)

\bigskip

The solution is to consider the spectrum of the unfiltered PAM signal.
The effect of PAM is to duplicate the original spectrum around each
multiple of the sampling frequency.
Thus the unfiltered PAM signal contains the following tones.
$$12n-21\quad12n-10\quad12n-1\quad12n+1\quad12n+10\quad12n+21$$
The values $n=0$, $n=1$ and $n=2$ yield tones below the cutoff frequency.
$$\eqalign{
12(0)+1&=1\,{\rm kHz}\cr
12(1)-10&=2\,{\rm kHz}\cr
12(2)-21&=3\,{\rm kHz}\cr
}$$
