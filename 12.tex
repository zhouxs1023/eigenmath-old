Problem 8.1 (c) on page 32.

$$c_n={4n+3\over7n-5}$$

1. Limit looks to be $c={4\over7}$, set up the relation:

$$\left|{4n+3\over7n-5}-{4\over7}\right|<\epsilon$$

2. Combine denominators to get:

$$\left|{7(4n+3)-4(7n-5)\over7(7n-5)}\right|<\epsilon$$

3. Multiply out and simplify to get:

$$\left|{28n+21-28n+35\over49n-35}\right|
=\left|{41\over49n-35}\right|<\epsilon$$

4. Term is positive so drop absolute value:

$${41\over49n-35}<\epsilon$$

5. Multiply both sides by $(49n-35)/\epsilon$ to get:

$${41\over\epsilon}<49n-35$$

6. Add 35 to both sides and divide by 49 to get:

$${41\over49\epsilon}+{5\over7}<n$$

7. Set $N$ to $41/49\epsilon+5/7$. Then $N<n$ implies that

$${41\over49\epsilon}+{5\over7}<n$$

8. Subtract ${5\over7}$ from both sides to get:

$${41\over49\epsilon}<n-{5\over7}$$

9. Multiply both sides by $49\over41$ to get:

$${1\over\epsilon}<{49n-35\over41}$$

10. Mutiply both sides by inverses to get:

$${41\over49n-35}<\epsilon$$

11. This is the same as the result in step 4. We can work backwards from there
to get the equation in step 1 so the limit is proved.
