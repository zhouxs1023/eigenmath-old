Page 17. Write a formal definition for the {\it infimum} or
{\it greatest lower bound} of a set.

\bigskip
A real number $s$ is the greatest lower bound for a set
$A\subseteq R$ if

(i) $s$ is a lower bound for $A$ and

(ii) if $b$ is any lower bound for $A$ then $s\ge b$.

\bigskip
Note that $s$ can be in $A$ because $s\le a$ for every $a\in A$.
