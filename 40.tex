From Unit 5, the following statements are equivalent.

1. $A$ is invertible.

2. $A^\tau$ is invertible.

3. $Ax=b$ has a unique solution for any $b\in R^n$.

4. $Ax=0$ has only the trivial solution.

5. $A$ is row equivalent to $I_n$.

6. $A$ is row equivalent to an invertible matrix.

7. $A$ can be written as the product of elementary matrices.

8. $A$ is not row equivalent to a matrix whose first row consists
entirely of $0$.

\bigskip
{\it Trivia: $A$ is noninvertible iff it is row equivalent to a matrix
with one of its rows consisting entirely of zero.}

From Unit 12, page 6.

1. $T$ is one-to-one if and only if the nullity of $T$ is zero.

2. $T$ is onto if and only if the rank of $T$ is the dimension of $W$.

\bigskip
From Unit 13, an inner product has the following properties.

1. $\langle a,b\rangle=\langle b,a\rangle$

2. $\langle a+b,c\rangle=\langle a,c\rangle+\langle b,c\rangle$

3. $\langle r\cdot a,b\rangle=r\,\langle a,b\rangle$

4. $\langle a,b\rangle\ge0$

5. $\langle a,a\rangle=0$ if and only if $a=0$
