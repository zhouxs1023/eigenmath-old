``Machine correctly adjusted'' type problems.
$$\eqalign{
P(C)&=0.95\cr
P(C')&=0.05
}$$
$$\eqalign{
P(D|C)&=0.03\cr
P(D|C')&=0.4
}$$

\bigskip
Sample is defective, probability of correct adjustment.
$$P(C|D)={P(D|C)P(C)\over P(D|C)P(C)+P(D|C')P(C')}
={0.03\times0.95\over0.03\times0.95+0.4\times0.05}
=0.5876$$

\bigskip
Sample is defective, probability of incorrect adjustment.
$$P(C'|D)={P(D|C')P(C')\over P(D|C)P(C)+P(D|C')P(C')}
={0.4\times0.05\over0.03\times0.95+0.4\times0.05}
=0.4124
$$

\bigskip
Sample is good, probability of correct adjustment.
$$P(C|D')={P(D'|C)P(C)\over P(D'|C)P(C)+P(D'|C')P(C')}
={0.97\times0.95\over0.97\times0.95+0.6\times0.05}
=0.9685
$$

\bigskip
Sample is good, probability of incorrect adjustment.
$$P(C'|D')={P(D'|C')P(C')\over P(D'|C)P(C)+P(D'|C')P(C')}
={0.6\times0.05\over0.97\times0.95+0.6\times0.05}
