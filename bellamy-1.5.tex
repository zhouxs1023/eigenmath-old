1.5 A transmission link has 14 dBrn of absolute noise power at a $-13$ dB TLP
input testpoint and 27 dBrn of absolute noise power at a $-3$ dB TLP
output testpoint.
How much absolute noise is added on the transmission link?

\bigskip

The 14 dBrn at the input testpoint is 27 dBrnCO which is 24 dBrn at the output
testpoint.
$$14\,{\rm dBrn}+13\,{\rm dB}=27\,{\rm dBrnCO}=24\,{\rm dBrn}+3\,{\rm dB}$$
The amount of noise added is the measured noise power (27 dBrn) minus the noise
due to the input testpoint (24 dBrn).
$$\Delta P=10^{2.7}-10^{2.4}=250\,{\rm pW}$$
