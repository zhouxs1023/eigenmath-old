1. Assume random variable $Z$ has a standard normal distribution.

\bigskip
a) $P\{Z>C\}=0.7357$, find $C$.

\medskip
The probability of observing $Z>C$ is $0.7357$.
This value, $0.7357$, is the area under the standard normal curve
obtained by integrating from $C$ to $+\infty$.
Table 1 in the Appendix gives us various integrals from
$-\infty$ to $C$.
So the issue is we have the area on the right of $C$ but the
table gives areas on the left of $C$.
Since the total area under the curve is $1$,
the area to the left of $C$ must be $1-0.7357=0.2643$.
What we have to do is search Table 1 in the appendix for the
case where the area is $0.2643$.
It is found for $z=-0.63$, therefore we have $C=-0.63$.

\bigskip
b) $P\{Z<C\}=0.9738$, find $C$.

\medskip
In table 1 of the appendix, the area $0.9738$ is found
for $z=1.94$, therefore $C=1.94$.

\bigskip
c) $P\{Z<C\}=0.0901$, find $C$.

\medskip
In table 1 of the appendix, the area $0.0901$ is found
for $z=-1.34$, therefore $C=-1.34$.
