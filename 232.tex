17.5. (b) Prove that every {\it polynomial function}
$p(x)=a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_nx^n$ is continuous on $R$.

\bigskip
By Theorem 17.4 (ii) and Exercise 17.5 (a) above, each term in the polynomial
is continuous.
By Theorem 17.4 (i), the sum of the terms in the polynomial is continuous.
Therefore, $p(x)$ is continuous.
