18.5. (a) Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions on $[a,b]$ such that
$f(a)\ge g(a)$ and $f(b)\le g(b)$. Prove that $f(x_0)=g(x_0)$ for at least
one $x_0$ in $[a,b]$.

\bigskip
Define a function $h=f-g.$
The function $h$ is continuous because $f$ and $g$ are continuous
(Theorem 17.4, p. 92).
We have $h(a)\ge0$ and $h(b)\le0$.
Now we can apply IVT and assert that some $x_0$ exists at which $h(x_0)=0$
(simply replace $y$ with 0 in the theorem).
Since $h(x_0)=f(x_0)-g(x_0)=0$, we have proved that $f(x_0)=g(x_0)$.
