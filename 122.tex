\item{1.} A new medication gives 10\% of the users an undesirable reaction.
If a sample of 15 users receives the medication, find the probability of:
\itemitem{(a)} exactly two undesirable reactions
\itemitem{(b)} at least four undesirable reactions
\itemitem{(c)} at most one undesirable reaction
\itemitem{(d)} more than one and less than five undesirable reactions

\bigskip
Solution:
We see that the outcome is binary, like heads or tails, and there
are $n=15$ trials. Hence we should use the binomial distribution
with ${\rm p}=0.10$.
$$
p(x)={}_nC_x\cdot{\rm p}^x\cdot(1-{\rm p})^{n-x}
={}_{15}C_x\cdot(0.1)^x\cdot(0.9)^{15-x}
$$

\beginsection (a) Find the probability of exactly two undesirable reactions.

Solution: We want to find $P(X=2)$.
$$p(2)={}_{15}C_2\cdot(0.1)^2\cdot(0.9)^{15-2}=0.2669$$

\beginsection (b) Find the probability of at least four undesirable reactions.

Solution: The trick here is to carefully parse the expression ``at least four.''
We want to find
$$P(X\ge 4)=1-P(X\le3)$$
We have
$$\eqalign{
p(0)&={}_{15}C_0\cdot(0.1)^0\cdot(0.9)^{15-0}=0.2059\cr
p(1)&={}_{15}C_1\cdot(0.1)^1\cdot(0.9)^{15-1}=0.3432\cr
p(2)&={}_{15}C_2\cdot(0.1)^2\cdot(0.9)^{15-2}=0.2669\cr
p(3)&={}_{15}C_3\cdot(0.1)^3\cdot(0.9)^{15-3}=0.1285\cr
}$$
Hence
$$P(X\ge 4)=1-p(0)-p(1)-p(2)-p(3)=0.0556$$
This can also be computed with Excel as follows.
$${\rm\tt=1-BINOMDIST(3,15,0.1,TRUE)}$$
where {\tt TRUE} means to sum from 0 to 3.

\beginsection (c) Find the probability of at most one undesirable reaction.

Solution:
$$P(X\le1)=p(0)+p(1)=0.5490$$

\beginsection (d) Find the probability of more than one and less than five undesirable reactions.

Solution:
$$P(1<X<5)=p(2)+p(3)+p(4)=0.4382$$
With Excel:
$${\rm\tt=BINOMDIST(4,15,0.1,TRUE)-BINOMDIST(1,15,0.1,TRUE)}$$
