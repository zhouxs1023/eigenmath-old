3.3 How much does the signal-to-noise ratio of a uniform PCM encoder
improve when 1 bit is added to the codeword?

\bigskip

Start with equation 3.4 in the book.
$${\rm SQR}=7.78+20\log_{10}(A/q)$$
The quantization interval q is inversely proportional to the number of bits
n in the codeword.
$$q={k\over2^n}$$
Substituting this for q in equation 3.4 we get
$$\eqalign{
{\rm SQR}&=7.78+20\log_{10}(2^nA/k)\cr
&=7.78+20\log_{10}(A/k)+20\log_{10}2^n\cr
&=7.78+20\log_{10}(A/k)+6.02n
}$$
We see that if we increase n by 1 the signal-to-noise ratio improves by
6.02 dB.
