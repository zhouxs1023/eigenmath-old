2. Bowl $A$ contains two red chips;
bowl $B$ contains two white chips;
bowl $C$ contains one red chip and one white chip;
bowl $D$ contains one red chip and one blue chip;
bowl $E$ contains one white chip and one blue chip.
A bowl is randomly selected, and one chip is taken at random.
If the selected chip is white, what is the probability that
the other chip in the bowl is red?

\bigskip
Bowl $C$ is the only bowl with a red and white chip so our task is to find
$$P(C|w)$$
There are four white chips so $P(w)=4/10$.
We have
$$P(C|w)={P(w\cap C)\over P(w)}
={P(C)P(w|C)\over P(w)} = {(1/5)\times(1/2)\over4/10}={1\over4}$$
Note how conditional probability and the multiplication rule allowed us
to turn things around.
We started with $P(C|w)$, which was not known, and turned it into an expression
involving $P(w|C)$, which is known.
