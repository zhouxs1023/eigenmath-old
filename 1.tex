Consider
$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\sin^2x\,dx=\infty$$
because all of the area is above the $x$-axis.
\bigskip
However,
$$\sin^2x={1\over2}-{1\over2}\cos2x$$
and
$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\cos2x\,dx=0$$

\bigskip
But in the latter case we have to integrate over ${1\over2}\,dx$
which is infinity.
In other words, the area under the curve $x={1\over2}$
is infinity.
