2. Assume random variable $t_n$ has a $t$-distribution with
$n$ degrees of freedom.

\bigskip
a) $P\{t_{12}<C\}=0.01$, find $C$.

\medskip
Consulting Table 3 in the appendix, we obtain $t=2.681$
for 12 degrees of freedom and an area under the curve
of $a=0.01$.
The table gives us $t$ for the area under the curve
from $t$ to $+\infty$.
Since the area we are looking for, $0.01$, is the integral from
$-\infty$ to $C$, we can get the answer by negating $t$.
This can be done because the $t$-distribution is symmetric.
We have $C=-t=-2.681$.
Note that in Table 3 we are looking up $t$ given the area,
contrary to Table 1 in which we are looking up the area
given $z$.

\bigskip
b) $P\{t_{14}>C\}=0.95$, find $C$.

\medskip
Table 3 in the appendix does not have an entry for $a=0.95$
but it does have one for $a=0.05$.
For $a=0.05$ and 14 degrees of freedom we obtain $t=1.761$.
This means that the integral from $t=1.761$ to $+\infty$ is
$0.05$.
Hence the integral from $-\infty$ to $t$ is $0.95$.
Again, due to the symmetry of the $t$-distribution,
we can flip it around and obtain $a=0.95$ for the integral
$-t$ to $+\infty$.
Therefore we have $C=-t=-1.761$.

\bigskip
c) $P\{|t_8|>C\}=0.05$, find $C$.

\medskip
The actual area we need to look up is $0.025$ because the area
$a=0.05$ is the total over two regions, $-\infty$ to $-C$
and $C$ to $+\infty$. From Table 3 we obtain $C=t=2.306$.
