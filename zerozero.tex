\noindent
It is a generally accepted convention that $0^0=1$.
By drawing a graph of the function $f(x)=|x^x|$ we can see why this
convention makes sense.
Of course, we want to draw the absolute value, or magnitude of $x^x$ because
$x^x$ is mostly complex when $x<0$.

We can see how $0^0=1$ results in a continuous line through $x=0$.

% What are the coordinates for the local minimum and maximum seen above?
