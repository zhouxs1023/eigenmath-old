{\bf Binomial Distribution}

\bigskip
A new medication has a 10\% chance of undesirable reaction.
The following questions are for a sample size of 15 people.

\bigskip
1. What is the probability of exactly two undesirable reactions?
$$\hbox{\tt BINOMDIST(2,15,0.1,FALSE)}=0.2669$$

\bigskip
2. What is the probability of at least four undesirable reactions?
$$\hbox{\tt 1-BINOMDIST(3,15,0.1,TRUE)}=0.0556$$

\bigskip
3. What is the probability of at most one undesirable reaction?
$$\hbox{\tt BINOMDIST(1,15,0.1,TRUE)}=0.5490$$

\bigskip
4. What is the probability of more than one and less than five
undesirable reactions?
$$\hbox{\tt BINOMDIST(4,15,0.1,TRUE)-BINOMDIST(1,15,0.1,TRUE)}=0.4382$$
