\beginsection Geometric distribution

Gives the probability of $n$ failures followed by a success.
$$P(X{=}n)=p(n)=(1-p)^np$$
$$\mu={1-p\over p}$$
$$\sigma^2={1-p\over p^2}$$
$$F(t)=1-(1-p)^{\lfloor t\rfloor+1}$$
$$P(X>k)=1-F(k)=(1-p)^{k+1}$$
$$M(t)={p\over1-e^t(1-p)}$$

\beginsection Example

An urn contains five red balls and and 15 white balls.
Find the probability that at least six draws are needed
to observe the first red ball.

\bigskip
\noindent Solution: The trick is to be careful with the
relational operator.
Observing a red ball on the sixth draw means $n=5$ failures.
Hence
$$P(X\ge5)=P(X>4)=(1-p)^{4+1}$$
