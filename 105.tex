\beginsection 1. Random variable

A function that maps each element
of a sample space to a real number.
Usually denoted by $X$.

\beginsection 2. Probability mass function

The probability of observing $X=x$.
$$p(x)=P(X=x)$$

\beginsection 3. Distribution function

The probability of observing $X\le x$.
$$F(x)=P(X\le x)$$
It is found by summing over $p(x)$.
$$F(x)=\sum_{t\le x}p(t)$$

\end
