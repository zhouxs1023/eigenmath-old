/* Progress in computer science does not always go forward.

Using Pascal, people had to write their programs upside down.

Then wonderful C came along. K & R created a perfect programming language.

And with C, people no longer had to write their programs upside down.

They could put main at the top.

Then a committee came along and broke C with their prototype rule.

After that, people had to start writing their programs upside down again.

Technically, prototypes should not be necessary.

In the 1980's Borland had a beautiful C compiler that did type checking without
using prototypes.

The following code is a work-around for the prototype rule.

It generates a prototype file so I can avoid writing and maintaining prototype
declarations and still keep the code rightside up.
