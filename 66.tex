1. Construct and interpret a 90\% confidence interval.

\bigskip
For the 8 sample data points the mean
is $75.58$ and the standard deviation is $4.517$.
We want to find the value $c$ such that
$$P\{75.58-c<\bar Y<75.58+c\}=0.90$$
The calculation is
$$\eqalign{
P\{75.58-c<\bar Y<75.58+c\}
&=P\{{\sqrt8\,(75.58-c-75.58)\over4.517}<Z<{\sqrt8\,(75.58+c-75.58)\over4.517}\}\cr
&=P\{-0.6262c<Z<0.6262c\}\cr
&=1-2P\{Z<-0.6262c\}=0.90
}$$
We have
$$P\{Z<-0.6262c\}=0.05$$
then by Excel and NORMINV$(0.05,1,0)$ we have
$$-0.6262c=-1.645$$
$$c=2.627$$
The confidence interval is
$$75.58\pm2.627$$
The confidence interval indicates there is a 90\% chance that
$$72.95<\mu<78.21$$
where $\mu$ is the mean (which is unknown) of the entire population of patients.
