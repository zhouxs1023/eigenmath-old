1. Construct and interpret a 90\% confidence interval.
This exercise appears on p. 27 of lecture042{.}ppt.
$$n=8$$
$$\bar Y=75.575$$
$$S=4.517$$
$$1-\alpha=0.90$$
$$t_{(7,0.05)}=1.895$$
$$t_{(7,0.05)}S/\sqrt n=3.026$$
The confidence interval is
$$75.575\pm3.026$$
The confidence interval indicates there is a 90\% chance that
$$72.55<\mu<78.60$$
where $\mu$ is the mean (which is unknown) of the entire population of patients.
