Linear Algebra FAQ

\beginsection What does ``onto'' mean?

Let $T:V\rightarrow W$.
Then $T$ is onto (or surjective) if for every point $w$ in $W$
there is also a point $v$ in $V$ such that
$T(v)=w$.
Another way of saying it is that the image of $T$ is an improper
subset of $W$.
{\it See Unit 9, def. 2.4 at the bottom of p. 7.}

\beginsection What does one-to-one mean?

Let $T:V\rightarrow W$.
Then $T$ is one-to-one (or injective) if for any $a,b\in V$,
$a\ne b$ implies that $T(a)\ne T(b)$.
{\it See Unit 9, def. 2.4 at the bottom of p. 7.}

\beginsection What is an isomorphism?

A function that is both one-to-one and onto.
Two vector spaces are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them.

{\it See Unit 9, p. 7}.

\beginsection What does ``dimension'' mean?

Every vector space has a basis.
The dimension of a vector space is the cardinality of its basis.

{\it See Unit 11, p. 1.}
